Boot Camp Initial Thoughts
I've been working retail jobs basically my whole career. 
I never finished college, started a few times.
Never had any intention of going back to school this bootcamp made me reconsider.
It's much easier to wrap my head around 11 weeks than a few years.
I know it's going to be hard.  I've messed around with web design.
I understand how complicated things can get.  I think I'd make a way
better .net developer than a web designer.  I'm just super excited to
get started with anything working with computers.
